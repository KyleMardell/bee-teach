## User Experience

### First time visitor goals
First time users of the Bee Teach app are likely to be educators, seeking resources to use while teaching children. With this in mind, first time visitor goals are to provide free high quality educational resources, in a simple to navigate environment, with a familiar feeling when viewing, posting and editing resources. First time visitors should be impressed by simplicity and usability of the app, the quality of resource and the sense of community, hopefully encouraging them to share resources of their own.

### Returning visitor goals
Returning visitors to the Bee Teach app are expected to be educators, impressed by their initial interaction with the app, looking to find or share more educational resources. Users may also return to the app to get involved in the Bee Teach community by reading and posting comments left on different resources. For returning visitors, the newest or most recently posted resources will be at the front or top of the page, providing them an quick and easy way to view the newest posted resources.

### App use goals
The app use goals are to provide a solution to a real-world problem, providing free educational resources, through a simple, familiar feeling, easy to navigate web app. The app should provide educators with a way to find free resource materials, share resources of their own through images, written content or links, and get involved in the Bee Teach community by posting comments. Overall the app should be a helpful free tool for all educators.

## Design

### Concept
My inspiration for the concept of the Bee Teach app came from my partner, who is a nursery teacher and often spends hours on an evening searching for fun resources to educate and entertain the classes children. Resources could be lesson plans, work/play-sheets, craft ideas, stories, or alternative lesson ideas. This meant each "educational resource" would commonly have written content, images or a mix of both, and when designing an app for this purpose, having a mixture of content available was a high priority, especially including multiple images per resource. I wanted to create an app where teachers and eductors could share resources they have created with a community, creating a bank of free resources, created by the Bee Teach community. I also wanted users to be able to comment on resources so they could show each other appreciation and share ideas with each other in a conversational style. This way users can see other educators positive reactions to their created or shared resources.

### Database
When designing the Bee Teach app, creating a solid database schema was paramount, as I wanted to avoid making large changes or unnecessary migrations later in the development phase. With this in mind, I designed my app using the wire-frame software [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to help envision what pages the app would need, thus helping me to understand the models my database would require. I created a database schema using the same wire-frame software, checking multiple times before finalising my plans and creating the database models.
